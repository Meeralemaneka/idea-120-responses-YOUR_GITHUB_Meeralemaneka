According to Barthes, the three messages that an image contains are linguistic as in textual, symbolic as in if the image has any depicting any deeper meaning without being totally obvious and lastly literal which is quite self explanatory.
The example image that I have chosen is a campaign image of Jeffree Star for his famous makeup line. The image does not have any text. However, it does have a symbolic message in the form of the star logo behind Jeffree himself. Jeffree star is notoriously known for his unique last name, so his star logo adds a personal touch to this businesses. The literal message is the fact that Jeffree is in full glam makeup with a product from his line in his hand, it is pretty obvious that this is a campaign shoot.
However, people who do not keep up with the makeup world or are not interested in makeup in general will probably not guess that this particular image is a campaign for a makeup line, as the product is shaped in a way that a normal everyday product would not be. This image could be taken as a funky photoshoot.
