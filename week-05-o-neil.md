# Weapons Of Math Destruction

###### Cathy O'Neil

A ‘weapon of math destruction’, according to O’Neil is basically a machine learning model or algorithm consisting of three evident features; opacity, scale and damage. In the readings she basically talks about how these mathematical algorithms cause negative impact on already disadvantaged demographics while providing support to privileged ones. Because these algorithms are mathematical, people presume that they can’t go wrong and blindly believe in their results. The author tries to explain how this is wrong as a mere learning model can’t weed out bias and look at the larger picture when making decisions. Because of this reason unnecessary biases are formed that takeaway opportunities from people.
An example of a ‘weapon of math destruction’ in my opinion is the SAT in terms of college admissions. Being an international student of from Pakistan I have witnessed numerous peers being rejected admissions in prestigious institutions in the US merely because their SAT scores were not incredibly high. Mind you, these peers were talented art students with the good grades, top of the line  Cambridge examination results, long lists of extra curricular activities and exceptional recommendations. They were only rejected because their SAT score didn’t match up to the requirement. You can either be a math kid or an art kid. If you are both, you are blessed, but if you're not you should be penalized for it.
First of all, in Pakistan as per the British system  we complete several levels of calculus in high school which should already be enough to qualify for math qualifications. We are also made to give compulsory English Cambridge international examinations which is also an English qualification. The English portion in SAT is never used in practical life and I don’t see how its fair that it is use to determine a persons literal future. Other qualifications should be taken into account more effectively.
