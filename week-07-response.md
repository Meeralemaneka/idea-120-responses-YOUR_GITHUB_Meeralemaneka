# Something is wrong on the internet

I highly agree with the problems that Bridle narrates in his article “Something is wrong on the internet”. I have been baby sitting my nephew of 11 months for the past 2 months and the only thing that get him to stop crying is a very specific nursery rhyme on YouTube called ‘coco melon’. This has always been very disturbing to me and his mom and we try to limit his exposure to these videos at the utmost. It is literally like a drug. One minute the kid will be bawling his eyes out and the next minute he will be totally fine, it makes me wonder what that one very specific video has. On the other hand, toddlers who are a little older who can maneuver themselves around these videos can actually fall into the wrong kind of content that can actually traumatize them. I have a younger cousins who watches some ‘verified’ mine craft YouTube channel which my aunt very closely monitored. But, he stumbled into a disturbing video one day and couldn’t sleep for days and mind you the video looked exactly like the videos he usually watched.

Bridles vision for internet is not be complicit in abuse. They shouldn’t just be running on ways to make maximum revenue if it means they are complicit in way of abuse of children. The writer says that the only solution for this ‘abuse’ to end this is to put a stop to the whole service as there is no other way around it. These ‘pirated’ and weird addictive videos make their way into kids’ kind one way or another and I totally agree with that. I don’t think kids’ that young need to be watching screens anyway.
