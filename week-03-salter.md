# The Gesamtkunstwerk

###### The Total Work Of Art

Taking into account Wagners festival house for his production, a lot of contemporary all-immersive art experiences are built upon primarily the same principal the genius composer was going for. He had a dark room with just his stage lit up, the choir was unseen to eliminate any any distraction from the main subject. Provided the level of technology at the time, he had the room specifically built in a way that it had great acoustics and audience positioning to really bring the whole 
experience together.

Based of off this, in contemporary times we have examples like 4D movie theaters and children rides that take the same idea and with todays technology leveling it up. We have things like smoke machines, water shooters, advance audio systems, 3D screens, mechanics that makes seats twists and turn to make the viewers experience a truly immersive one. 

The one experience that sticks out to me the most is the immersive Van Gogh exhibition that has been put on all over the States. This work of art used projectors which projected Van Gogh’s Art all over the room. The projections were seamless and almost felt like the room was painted but then a different a picture would fill the space. It was surreal. The projectors were placed in ways that every nook and corner of the room was projected, the floor, the pillars, objects. Even the views walking around seemed to be a part of the art. In contemporary times there’s so much we can do to create art that would be considered a ‘gesamtkunstwerk’, in terms of architecture, top of the line graphics, audio and machinery.


Rhizome Anthology : a work that I would consider a Gesamtkunstwerk is [The File Room](https://anthology.rhizome.org/the-file-room)
