## Clone Video

My vision for this project is to kind of create a video with a normal setting of me sitting in my room as I normally would on my laptop attending a zoom call/working. But then I want to 'clone' myself and make it seem like another me is walking around the room doing other things, maybe even two other me's if i feel very ambitious.
