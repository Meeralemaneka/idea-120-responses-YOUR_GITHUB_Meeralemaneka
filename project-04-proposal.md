# Portfolio

For the first page I want to include a little introduction followed by a menu bar with options to choose each project. My idea is to have each project on different pages.

For Project one I will include detail screenshots of the website as well as an embedded link. I will also want to give a little context to the poem if necessary. For Project two I want to include some stills from my video as well as the video. For project three I will have to also include some stills of the twine game and give a little detail about what is going on and what my thought process behind the game was.

For my fourth project I have decided to add a project I did for my previous IDEAS course where the topic was "make a repair", i will be giving a little context to my piece with some pictures of the actual artwork.
